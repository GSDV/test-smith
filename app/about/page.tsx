                        Welcome to TestSmith, the digital blacksmith of your brainpower! 🔨🧠

                        Here at TestSmith, we take your files — yes, those lecture slides, PDFs, and mystery notes from Week 7 — and forge them into handcrafted quizzes designed to test your knowledge, your patience, and occasionally your sanity.
                    </p>

                        We believe learning shouldn’t be painful… but it also shouldn’t be too easy. That’s why TestSmith’s state-of-the-art question generator reads your materials, interprets your deepest academic fears, and then politely transforms them into multiple-choice ambushes. When you answer, we’ll be right there to review your results — encouraging you, correcting you, or softly judging you depending on how confident you sounded while clicking “Submit.”
                    </p>

                        Our mission? To make self-studying feel less like a chore and more like a friendly duel between you and your own notes. Whether you’re cramming for finals, brushing up on forgotten facts, or just seeing how much of your textbook you actually read, TestSmith’s got your back (and your wrong answers).
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mt-2">
                        We’re powered by caffeine, chaotic energy, and a suspicious number of AI algorithms that have definitely read more of your study material than you have.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mt-2">
                        So attach your files. Summon your quiz. Embrace the chaos.<br/> Because at the end of the day — pass or fail — TestSmith believes in you… kind of.
