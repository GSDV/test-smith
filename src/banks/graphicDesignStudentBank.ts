      aiResponse:
        "A good answer mentions that about 1 in 20 people have color deficiency (e.g., red-green), so designers should pick color-blind safe palettes and reinforce categories with other variables like shape or value for accessibility."

      question: "Highly saturated colors are recommended because they reduce visual fatigue.",
