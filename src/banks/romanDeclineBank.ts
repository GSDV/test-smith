        "A good answer notes that barbarians such as Huns, Goths, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths invaded; short-term life often stayed 'still Roman,' but long-term the invasions accelerated western decline, leading to a 'barbarian West' and the start of the Middle Ages, symbolized by Odovacar’s deposition of Romulus Augustulus."
